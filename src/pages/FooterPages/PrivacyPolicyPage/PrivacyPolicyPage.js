        To provide the best customer satisfaction, we provide the following
        solutions. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding
        the Return Policy by emailing us at the restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preparation of your order will begin immediately after your order has
        been confirmed. We cannot accept cancellations once your order has been
        confirmed with the restaurant or third party.
      </p>
      <h3>Food Order Errors</h3>
      <p>
        If you receive food that is different from your receipt, we sincerely
        apologize. Please call us or your third-party delivery company as soon
        as you notice that there was an error in your order.
      </p>
      <p>
        •For credit card payments, we will issue a cancel payment on the order
        with an error and recharge the corrected amount.
      </p>
      <p>
        •For cash payments, you will be asked to pay the difference of the
        balance if the new food has a greater value than the food received in
        error.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same way, you will receive the difference of the balance back as
        credit for the new item if less than the food received in error. In some
        cases, we may offer you a store credit. In all cases, please return the
        food order in the original container(s)* to our host.
      </p>
      <h3>Food Order Incomplete</h3>
      <p>
        In the rare occasion that you do not receive food that is on your
        receipt, we will make it up to you. Please call us as soon as you notice
        that any food items were not received in your order. You may cancel the
        missed food before we prepare it without any question, and we will
        refund the amount to a credit card or we will refund you with a store
        credit. No cash refunds.
      </p>
      <h3>Food Dissatisfaction</h3>
      <p>
        We cook our food fresh to order with only the finest and freshest
        ingredients. We take great care and pride in all of the dishes we make.
        Refunds and/or replacement food are available upon request for orders in
        which the food is wrong, omitted and other similar circumstances.
        Refunds are not typically provided for food that a guest simply does not
        like.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the food has been discarded, repackaged or tampered with then we
        cannot verify its origin or issue and cannot issue any discount, refund
        or store credit.
      </p>
      <h3>Cancel Order</h3>
      <p>
        Sorry, we cannot cancel, refund or give store credit if you change your
        mind or mistakenly order an item after the order is prepared. We cannot
        provide any refund or store credit for non-food items or beverages.
      </p>
      <h3>Cancelling Restaurant Delivery</h3>
      <p>
        We cannot cancel if an order is already in progress and on the delivery
        route. If the driver made a reasonable effort to contact you after
        arriving at your requested location, you may not be eligible for a
        refund.
